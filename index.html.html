<h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
<h2>What is this website is about:</h2>
        <p>This website is here to practice my html coding, here i will test out the different coding I have learnt in order to perfect my own skills within web design.</p>


<h3>List of elements i have used and know so far:
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Element H1,H2,H3,H4,H5 and H6 are used to give a heading size dependant on the heading required</li>
    <li>Element Li is used to list things and is used between ul or ol which are unlisted or open listed. Open listed will show numbers and unlisted will show bullet points.</li>
    <li>You can also provide links using the anchor which is just a and between the anchor you can also add links to files using img and then source. When applying source you must put = after in order for you to input the link as this is seen as a value.</li>
    <li>If you would like to link to a file, webpage or text file, you need to use href at the beginning of the anchor.</li>
    <li>There is also the option to add "alt" as an input for text that will be read to the user when they place their curser on the text that is provided within this tag</li>
</ul>
<h2>Things i need to remember</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Always use indentations and Nesting in order to keep a clean page of code</li>
    <li>make sure all links work properly and check for any other errors within my coding</li>
    <li>take notes so that i can look back should i experience similar issues so that i can fix them more efficiently.</li>
</ol>
